# odin-to-do-list
A To-Do List made as part of The Odin Project's 'JavaScript' course.

When first loading the page, you should be taken to a 'default' empty project. By clicking the 'List' button on the left of the project's button bar, you can return to the project list display.

In the project list display, you can add new projects by clicking the 'New Project' panel. The input will verify your new project has a unique name that follows the correct regex pattern before letting you create a new project. On creation, your project will be empty.

Each project in the project list has two buttons; the green 'Edit' button will take you to the project's item list, whereas the red 'Delete' button will remove your project immediately. It is worth noting you cannot change a project's name from the project list; to do so, go into your project and change it there.

In a project's item list there are many options to choose from.

At the top of the page you can change the name of your project. Remember, projects cannot have duplicate names. The name will not be changed until you click the 'Save' button.

You can return to the project list (as previously mentioned) by pressing the 'List' button on the left of the button bar.

The button immediately to the right of that one is a 'Save' button. Any changes made to the project (including changing the project's name) will NOT be saved unless you press the 'Save' button.

The three buttons on the right are 'Add', 'Refresh' and 'Sort', respectively.

The 'Add' button will add a new template item to the top of your list.

The 'Refresh' button will update the due date strings for the items in the list.

The 'Sort' button has many options itself. There are five categories of sort to choose from: Date Added, Due By, Priority, Status and Alphabetical. Each one can have one of its options selected to sort the items in that order. When multiple options are selected, the order in which those categories are considered when sorting the items are displayed at the top of the sort menu. The order can be changed by either deselecting one of the categories or deleting a category from the sort order by clicking the 'Delete' button on one of the categories in the sort order part of the sort menu.

Each to-do item itself is composed of many elements. By default (unless creating a new item), a to-do item will be 'collapsed', meaning you can only see the item's name, due date and priority (and change all of them accordingly). To expand the display and see more of the to-do items options, click the 'Expand' button on the left of each item. This will then display the description in addition to 'notes' and 'checklist' sections. Notes and checklist items can be added by clicking the '+' button underneath each one respectively.

The 'Tick' button that is displayed on an item when it is expanded will set that item to complete.

The 'Delete' button that is displayed on an item when it is expanded will delete that item from your project.

When adding a new item using the 'Add' button, by default it will be in an 'expanded' state. You must click the 'Add' button to add it to the existing list of items. It will be sorted automatically when added.

You can have a maximum of 100 projects, each with a maximum of 100 items. Those items can have a maximum of 10 notes and 10 checklist items.
